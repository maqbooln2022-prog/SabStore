-- Kirana / multi-shop billing app — schema
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor (or via `supabase db push`).
-- Mirrors the data model in PROJECT_BRIEF.md, ported from the working prototype.
--
-- Products and suppliers are OWNER-level master data, shared across every
-- shop that owner runs. shop_products/shop_suppliers are the per-shop
-- "instance" of a product/supplier. shop_members gives real, RLS-enforced
-- staff accounts: each worker is a genuine Supabase auth user (PIN as
-- their password, created server-side via app/api/staff/create) with
-- per-module permissions checked by every table's policies below, not
-- just hidden in the UI. shops.enabled_modules is a shop-level on/off
-- toggle per module, independent of per-worker permissions.
--
-- If you're upgrading an existing project instead of running this fresh,
-- use supabase/migrations/001_shared_catalog.sql and
-- supabase/migrations/002_staff_roles.sql instead.
