-- Migrates an existing SabStore project from shop-scoped items/suppliers
-- to the shared owner-level catalog (products/shop_products,
-- suppliers/shop_suppliers). Run this in the Supabase SQL editor.
--
-- This is a RESET, not a data-preserving migration: it drops items,
-- suppliers, movements, bills, and credits and recreates them in the new
-- shape. `shops` (and reconciliations/draws/expenses, which don't
-- reference items) are left untouched. Only run this if you're OK
-- losing existing items/bills/movements/credits/suppliers test data —
-- reseed afterwards with scripts/reseed-shop-products.mjs.
